# Recursion Schemes is Scala
This project is an exploration of implementating the recursion schemes 
discussed in the series of blog posts here: https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/

The first scheme, the catamorphism, has been implemented in both scala 2 and scala 3/dotty
in order to explore some of the upcoming capabilities in the Scala language. For now, I have only implemented
the folds for catamorphisms and paramorphisms, but will come back to the corresponding unfolds and Coalgebras
before moving on to histomorphisms and their unflods, futumorphisms
